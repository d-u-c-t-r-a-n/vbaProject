# vbaProject
This project was created within 8 days without any prior knowledge to the language. The main purpose of this project is to learn a new topic (in this case a programming language) and to establish meaningful knowledge (code) as fast as possible.                
      
The Instance Calculator determines the number of days employees take off. There are a number of factors that influence the count:        
    1. The day range include weekends  
    2. The day range include holidays    
    3. The employees normal shifts exceeds certain hours  
Return: Counts of longterm (more than a certain number of days in a row) or shortterm (less than longterm requirement)  
    
Since excel has no function tailored for this specific problem, InstanceCalculator can counts longterm and shortterm instances for each employees.      
  
Requirement: An unduplicated list of employees, with 1 entry for every name.
